# Python Fundamentals Project 

This project demonstrates Python fundamentals, including:
- variables and data types
- conditional statements
- loops (for, while)
- functions
- basic problem solving
  
The application is a console-based program that works with user input,
validates data, and performs simple calculations.

## Logic overview

The program collects user input (name, age, and a list of numeric values), validates the data using loops and conditional statements, stores numeric values in a list, and processes the data in preparation for further analysis. The project demonstrates clean Python fundamentals, working with lists, and a clear, logical program flow.
